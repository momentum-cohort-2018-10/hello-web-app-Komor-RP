# Hello Web App

As your first step in learning Django, you are going to read [Hello Web App](https://hellowebbooks.com/learn-django/) by Tracy Osborn and follow along with its tutorial. As you follow along, build your application in this repository.

## Installation instructions

We are using Pipenv for managing our projects, so the installation instructions in _Hello Web App_ do not directly apply.

To start your project, make sure to run `pipenv install` in the directory with this `README.md` file and then run `pipenv shell` to enter the project virtualenv. After that, you can follow along with the instructions starting at "[Start your Django project]"(https://hellowebbooks.com/setup/#start-project).

## Schedule

- **Day 1**: Finish chapters 1-5
- **Day 2**: Finish chapters 6-7
- **Day 3**: Finish chapters 8-9
- **Day 4 (and weekend)**: Finish chapters 10-13

Please move forward to chapters 14 and beyond if you have time; if not, you can read them and follow along on your own time next week.
